HTML Page Structure
-	A typical HTML page comprises of 2 sections at high level
o	Document Declaration
o	Document Scope

Document Declaration:
-	Every browser has its own parser.
-	Parser can understand various versions of HTML and JavaScript.
-	If a parser can understand only up to HTML 4 and ES4 [JavaScript] then it is known as “Legacy”.
-	If parser can understand all versions of HTML and JavaScript including HTML 5 and ES5 above, then it is known as “Modern”
-	When you design a HTML page you have to tell about the version of HTML to parser.
-	You can define HTML version by using “Document Declaration”.
-	HTML document declaration for HTML 5 Version is defined by using following Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE html>
-	If you are designing any HTML page in HTML 5 Version then it must start with “Document Declaration”

Document Scope:
-	Every browser has the ability to display multiple documents simultaneously at the same time.
-	Hence it is important to define the scope of every document.
-	HTML document scope is defined by using “<html>” tag.
-	
Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    Document-1
</html>
<html>
    Document-2
</html>

-	Every document scope must define which language culture it is using.
-	Every language culture has different techniques of presenting numbers, date time value, currency values etc.
-	Various countries have various culture techniques.
-	If you are designing a page for any specific culture the you have to mention the culture information.
en-IN	India, 	en-US	US, 	 en-GB	UK
-	The culture is defined by using an attribute “lang”

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-IN">
    
</html>

-	Document Scope is again divided into 2 major sections
o	Head Section
	<head> </head>
o	Body Section
	<body> </body>
